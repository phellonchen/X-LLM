Differing palates: Each person may have different preferences towards taste, which can lead to some people being displeased with their portion and may prefer others.\n\n3. Food waste: If there are no adaptable options for people who do not like certain foods, it may lead to food waste.

Food and Habitat: Bird species can be affected when they are searching for food or roosting sites due to the noise pollution and disturbance that can occur in flight activity zones.\n\n4.
