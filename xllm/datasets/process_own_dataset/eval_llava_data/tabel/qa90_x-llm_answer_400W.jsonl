{"question_id": 1, "text": "This section describes a mathematical formula known as the \"difference of squares\" formula, which states that a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b), where a and b are arbitrary real numbers and the symbol for \"is equal to\" is represented by the \"=\" sign. \n\nThe meaning of this formula is that by squaring both a and b and subtracting the results, we obtain the same answer as if we were to multiply (a+b) by (a-b). Note that a and b can be any real numbers, and that their signs can be the same or different. \n\nThis formula is extremely useful in mathematics, as it can be used to derive the square root of two numbers, as well as calculate their sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder. \n\nIn the image, the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 is represented using the symbols \"+\" and \"-\", which respectively denote the positive and negative square roots of the two numbers whose squares add up to x^2 and whose product is 6. The image shows how this function can be graphed, as well as its shape and variation. \n\nIt can be observed that the graph of this function has its vertex at the point (-2,-2), and that it intersects the x-axis at the points (2,0) and (3,0). The minimum value of the function occurs at x=-1, where f(x)=-2.5, while the maximum value occurs at x=3, where f(x)=4."}
