{"question_id": 50, "text": "These airplane activities may impact different bird species in the following ways:\n\n1. Flight noise: The flight noise of airplanes can create disturbance and may cause dehydration to some bird species, especially during long-haul flights or high-frequency air traffic.\n\n2. Collisions: During flight, the exhaust of airplanes can create turbulence, which may result in collisions with birds. This can negatively impact their health and survival.\n\n3. Food and Habitat: Bird species can be affected when they are searching for food or roosting sites due to the noise pollution and disturbance that can occur in flight activity zones.\n\n4. Startle effect: During takeoff and landing, the loud noise and vibrations produced by planes may cause birds to panic or become disoriented. This can lead to negative impacts on the health and well-being of some bird species.\n\n5. Health concerns: Some bird species may experience health issues due to active airplane activities, such as bone fractures, hearing loss, or vision impairments caused by engine noise, wind, or other flight-related factors.\n\nTo minimize the impact of these activities on bird species, we should implement measures that reduce the frequency of air traffic in sensitive habitats, provide bird-friendly architecture and habitat management practices, and limit noise pollution through sound barriers, flight trajectory adjustments, or other innovative solutions."}
